Development
-----------

I may be crazy, but I'm trying to do this development in quite a structured way even with some time pressure. For this reason, I've started with the following structure:

exp/	    --	experiments (work in progress to figure things out
perlweb/    --  the source in PerlWEB format
build/	    --  target dir for PerlWEB output (the actual source of the program and the documentation)
util/	    --  utilities, build script, install script?, vimrc snippets.
